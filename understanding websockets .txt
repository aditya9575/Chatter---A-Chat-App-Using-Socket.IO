websockets are a two way connection between client and server 

we implement sockets using socket.io 
(Socket.io is a js library for realtime web apps )

npm init -y 
npm i socket.io nodemon

****[
    To connect our client with our server socket we need to add a script to the frontend html head part->
    <script type="module" src="http://localhost:7000/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
 ]****

create an index.js file and inside it -> 
1)const io = require("socket.io")(7000)
2)then we do io.on("our decided event name" , callbackfunction)
so in short on trigger of this predefined event from front end our io will trigger this call back function 
example -> io.on("connection" , socket => {
    //event1- what socket does is that whenever it encounters user-joined event it will set the name to our users 
    socket.on("user-joined" , name => {
          user[socket.id] = name;
    })

    socket.on("send" , message=>{
        socket.broadcast.emit("receive" , {message:message, name: user[socket.id]})
    })
})
